My design choices are intentional and align with accessibility standards:

  - **Background**: `#FFCBC5` | RGB(255, 203, 197)
  - **Ratio**: 14.6 for stark legibility.

- **Balance & Aesthetics**
  - **Foreground**: `#FFFFFF` | RGB(255, 255, 255)
  - **Background**: `#3E3E21` | RGB(62, 62, 33)
  - **Ratio**: 10.96 for balanced visibility.

- **Emphasis & Clarity**
  - **Foreground**: `#000000` | RGB(0, 0, 0)
  - **Background**: `#A6CB9F` | RGB(166, 203, 159)
  - **Ratio**: 11.66 for distinct emphasis.

Each combination ensures content is accessible and pleasant to read.

## Hamburger Menu Integration

### Overview
The latest update introduces a responsive hamburger menu to improve mobile accessibility. This feature allows for a clutter-free navigation experience across various devices.

### Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts between desktop and mobile views seamlessly.
- **Interactive UI**: Features smooth navigation and collapsible menu for enhanced user experience.

### Implementation
- **HTML**: Includes a `.hamburger` button class visible only on devices with a width less than 768 pixels.
- **CSS**: Managed within `nav.css`, with media queries for responsive adjustments.
- **JavaScript**: Toggles the navigation links visibility based on user interactions.

### Usage
The hamburger menu can be tested by resizing the browser to under 768 pixels width or on a mobile device. Clicking the hamburger icon toggles the navigation links.

### Code and Future Plans
- **Source Code**: Available in `index.html`, `nav.css`, and `script.js`.
- **Future Enhancements**: Plans include refining UI animations and boosting accessibility based on user feedback.
