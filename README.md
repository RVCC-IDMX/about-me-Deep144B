My design choices are intentional and align with accessibility standards:

- **Contrast & Legibility**
  - **Foreground**: `#000000` | RGB(0, 0, 0)
  - **Background**: `#FFCBC5` | RGB(255, 203, 197)
  - **Ratio**: 14.6 for stark legibility.

- **Balance & Aesthetics**
  - **Foreground**: `#FFFFFF` | RGB(255, 255, 255)
  - **Background**: `#3E3E21` | RGB(62, 62, 33)
  - **Ratio**: 10.96 for balanced visibility.

- **Emphasis & Clarity**
  - **Foreground**: `#000000` | RGB(0, 0, 0)
  - **Background**: `#A6CB9F` | RGB(166, 203, 159)
  - **Ratio**: 11.66 for distinct emphasis.

Each combination ensures content is accessible and pleasant to read.

### Tools & Technologies
